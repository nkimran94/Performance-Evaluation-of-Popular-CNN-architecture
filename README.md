# Performance-Evaluation-of-Popular-CNN-architecture
This work represent an empirical analysis of the performance of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for identifying objects from images. The most popular convolution neural networks for object detection and object category classification from images are VGG16, ResNet50, Alex Nets and GoogLeNet,. A variety of image data sets are available to test the performance of different types of CNNâ€™s. The commonly found benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of a convolutional neural network are ImageNet dataset, Catdogs dataset and MNIST image data sets, natural object dataset. Till now we only have analyzed VGG16 and ResNet50 networks. I'm working on other networks.  I have taken the most popular CatDog data sets for our study, and I have created more image data by apply different preprocessing techniques like Gaussian Noise, Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur on that CatDog dataset, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations.
